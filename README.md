Assignment 2

Program Description
===================

# Program Task 1: Check If a Number is Even or Odd
---------------------------------------------------

- The program takes an integer input from the user.
- It uses the modulus operator (%) to determine whether the number is divisible by 2.
- If the remainder is 0, the number is Even.
- Otherwise, the number is Odd.

Example:
Input: 7  
Output: "7 is Odd"

---

# Program Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 using Loop
---------------------------------------------------------

- The program initializes a variable `sum` to 0.
- It uses a `for` loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 50.
- Each number is added to `sum` using the `+=` operator.
- Finally, the program prints the total sum.

Expected Output:
"Sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275"
